Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN s) consists of several interconnected sensor networks
that are used to communicate wirelessly to collect and transmit the data. These are used in
many areas like environmental monitoring, home surveillance, health care monitoring,
threat detection and in many more areas. WSNs also include many low-cost and low powersensing tools. The drawbacks in WSN include High energy consumption and low lifetime
of the network. To overcome these limitations, a new improved protocol has been
developed for energy efficient clustering in Wireless Sensor Networks. The E-DEEC
protocol is implemented by improving the DEEC algorithm by introducing another type of
node called supernodes. In the existing E-DEEC protocol, it did not consider the proximity
of advanced nodes to the Base Station and used a large amount of energy to convey the
report to the Base Station. This resulted in large dissipation of energy by the supernodes
with higher residual energy but far from the Base station when conveying their reports to
the Base station. So, a new algorithm iE-DEEC is proposed. In iE-DEEC, to select the
cluster heads we use distance of supernodes and the average distance of the nodes to the
base station. To evaluate the energy consumption and its performance, MATLAB R2020b
is being used. The result shows that this protocol is better than E-DEEC increasing
throughput, network lifetime and reduced energy consumption.
